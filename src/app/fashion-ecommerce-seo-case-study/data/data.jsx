      <p>
        In an industry where billion-dollar brands dominate search rankings,
        breaking through with organic SEO can feel impossible. Most luxury
        retailers rely on massive ad budgets, leaving emerging brands struggling
        for visibility. But we rewrote the rules. By developing a data-driven
        SEO strategy, we helped a cashmere apparel brand cut through the noise,
        outrank competitors, and achieve remarkable growth in just 12 months
        (ongoing).
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with only 35 keyword rankings, we expanded their visibility to
        1,100 keywords nationwide, with breakdown as follows;{" "}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ListPrupleIcon />
          826 transactional keywords
        </li>
        <li>
          <ListPrupleIcon />
          915 commercial keywords

          38 navigational keywords

          147 informational keywords ranking.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This increase in organic visibility led to a staggering $490,000 in
        revenue within six months, all from organic search. Most impressively,
        we secured top placements in Google’s AI-powered search features,
        allowing the brand to appear alongside major luxury fashion houses in
        sections such as “People Also Buy,” “Similar Brands,” and Google
        Shopping carousels.

        When we began working with the brand, it faced significant obstacles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ListPrupleIcon />
          The website was only ranking for 35 keywords, which severely
          restricted its organic reach.
        </li>
        <li>
          <ListPrupleIcon />
          The brand’s products were absent from high-intent shopping results,
          reducing opportunities for conversion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <ListPrupleIcon />
          Google’s Search Generative Experience did not recognize the brand,
          meaning it was missing out on premium placements in Google’s
          AI-powered suggestions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <ListPrupleIcon />

        <li>
          <ListPrupleIcon />
          Larger competitors had significantly stronger domain authority and

        To drive sustained organic growth, we developed a comprehensive keyword
        strategy that targeted high-intent searches at every stage of the
        customer journey. Instead of focusing solely on transactional keywords,
        we ensured the brand ranked for a diverse range of search queries,
        capturing traffic from initial research to final purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        We secured rankings for 826 transactional keywords, such as “best men’s
        cashmere sweater” and “luxury women’s cashmere coat”, directly targeting
        customers ready to buy
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, we ranked for 915 commercial keywords, including “best
        sustainable cashmere brands” and “cashmere vs wool”, which catered to
        shoppers in the consideration phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        By optimizing for 38 navigational keywords, we strengthened brand
        recognition and engagement for direct searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        To further expand visibility, we created high-ranking blog content
        targeting 147 informational keywords, answering key consumer questions
        like “how to care for cashmere” and “difference between cashmere
        grades.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This multi-layered approach ensured the brand attracted, educated, and
        converted customers at every touchpoint, ultimately driving higher
        organic traffic and revenue.

        With the rise of Google Shopping and AI-powered search experiences, we
        strategically optimized the brand’s product listings to enhance
        visibility in these high-traffic areas. By refining product schema
        markup, descriptions, and high-quality images, we ensured that the
        brand’s items stood out in Google Shopping results, increasing
        click-through rates and conversions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key achievement was securing placement in Google’s “People Also Buy”
        and “Similar Brands” sections, features typically dominated by
        established luxury retailers. We achieved this by structuring product
        data in an AI-friendly way, making it easier for Google’s algorithms to
        associate the brand with high-end competitors.

      <p>
        Additionally, we optimized for Google’s Search Generative Experience,

        suggestions.
      </p>

        By capitalizing on these AI-driven search opportunities, we positioned
        the brand alongside industry leaders, expanding brand awareness and
        accelerating organic sales growth.
