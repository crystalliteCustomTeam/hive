          An insurance company based in California approached us with a clear
          challenge: despite offering competitive policies, their website
          struggled to attract and convert visitors. Competing against
          well-established insurance providers across the state, they needed an
          SEO strategy that would improve their visibility, engagement, and lead
          generation.

          With an ongoing SEO campaign, we helped them achieve significant
          growth within <i>11 months</i>.

          Despite having a well-structured website, the company faced several

        A thorough website audit revealed several performance issues that were
        negatively impacting both rankings and user engagement. To address these
