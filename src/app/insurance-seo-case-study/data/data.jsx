          An insurance company based in California approached us with a clear
          challenge: despite offering competitive policies, their website
          struggled to attract and convert visitors. Competing against
          well-established insurance providers across the state, they needed an
          SEO strategy that would improve their visibility, engagement, and lead
          generation.
        </p>

          With an ongoing SEO campaign, we helped them achieve significant
          growth within 11 months.

          Despite having a well-structured website, the company faced several
          roadblocks:

        <ul>
