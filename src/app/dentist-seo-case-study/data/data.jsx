          A dental practice in Los Angeles approached us with a clear challenge:
          to stand out in a highly competitive local market and generate more
          leads in patient appointments. Despite offering a wide range of dental
          services, their online presence was underperforming, resulting in
          missed opportunities to attract regular patients. Their goals were
          straightforward: increase online visibility in Los Angeles, drive more
          appointment bookings through lead forms and calls, and establish
          authority in the local dental market.

        To drive sustained organic growth, we developed a comprehensive keyword
        strategy that targeted high-intent searches at every stage of the
        customer journey. Instead of focusing solely on transactional keywords,
        we ensured the brand ranked for a diverse range of search queries,

        Additionally, we ranked for 915 commercial keywords, including “best
        sustainable cashmere brands” and “cashmere vs wool”, which catered to
        shoppers in the consideration phase.

        By optimizing for 38 navigational keywords, we strengthened brand
        recognition and engagement for direct searches.

        To further expand visibility, we created high-ranking blog content

        like “how to care for cashmere” and “difference between cashmere
        grades.”
