                        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
                        <p>We prioritize customer satisfaction and aim to deliver exceptional services across all our offerings. However, there may be situations where a refund is requested. This policy outlines the terms and conditions for refunds across our services.</p>
                        <h2>General Terms for Refunds</h2>
                        <h4>Eligibility for Refunds:</h4>
                        <p>Refund requests must be submitted in writing within 15 days of project initiation or next payment (whichever comes later).</p>
                        <p>Refunds are considered only for services where tangible deliverables have not been provided, and no significant progress has been made.</p>
                        <h4>Exclusions:</h4>
                        <p>No refunds will be issued for services already rendered, work completed, or milestones achieved as per the project timeline.</p>
                        <p>Third-party costs (e.g., hosting, domain, ad spend, licensed images, etc.) are non-refundable.</p>
                        <h4>Evaluation Period</h4>
                        <p>Refund requests will undergo an evaluation process to determine eligibility. This may involve reviewing deliverables, project progress, and communication logs.</p>
                        <h2>Service-Specific Refund Policies</h2>

                        <p><strong>Refund Window:</strong>Refunds are only available within the first 30 days of the contract if no measurable progress has been made (e.g., strategy development or keyword research).</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> SEO is a long-term strategy; results cannot be guaranteed within a short period. Services such as competitor analysis, keyword research, and technical audits are non-refundable once delivered.</p>

                        <h4>4. Web Design & Development</h4>
                        <p><strong>Refund Window:</strong>Refunds can be requested within 14 days of payment if no designs or development work has commenced.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong>Any designs, wireframes, or code delivered to the client will be charged proportionately and deducted from the refund amount.</p>

                        <p><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong>Refunds are not available once development has begun, as app development involves significant resource allocation.</p>
