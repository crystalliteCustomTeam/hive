          An African safari and tour company approached us, they had a major
          problem: despite offering unforgettable wildlife experiences, their
          website was nearly invisible on search engines. Competing against
          well-established names in the safari industry, they struggled to
          attract organic traffic, limiting their ability to reach
          adventure-seekers worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determined to change this, we launched a comprehensive SEO strategy
          tailored to their niche. Within just eight months of working with us,
          the results spoke for themselves.

        <p>
          Even though their website was well-structured, it lacked visibility in
          search engine results. Their most relevant keywords for African
          safaris and tours were dominated by competitors, making it nearly
          impossible for potential customers to find them.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, their website had:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <ListPrupleIcon />
            Minimal high-quality backlinks, reducing its authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            <ListPrupleIcon />
            Poor content optimization, failing to target the right audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <ListPrupleIcon />
            Low engagement and conversion rates due to outdated content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To rank nationwide, we needed to improve their keyword targeting,
          content strategy, and site authority.

        To address these issues, we devised a strategy that focused on three
        core areas:

      <p>
        <strong>Keyword Research & Content Optimization</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We conducted in-depth keyword research to identify high-intent search
        terms used by travelers looking for African safaris. We then optimized
        the site’s key pages and created new, engaging content designed to rank
        for these keywords. Blog posts, destination guides, and informative
        pages were all crafted to not only rank well but also provide value to
        potential travelers.

          A thorough audit revealed several technical issues that were holding
          the site back. Slow page speeds, broken links, and missing schema
          markup were all fixed to ensure search engines could properly index
          the site. Mobile optimization was also a priority, ensuring a seamless
          experience for users browsing on smartphones and tablets.

          We implemented a strategic link-building campaign to earn high-quality
          backlinks from travel blogs, tourism directories, and industry
          publications. These efforts boosted the website’s domain authority,
          helping it climb the search rankings and compete with larger, more
          established competitors.

        To capitalize on Google’s Deals feature, we created a dedicated “Deals”
        page optimized for search visibility. Structured deal markup was
        implemented to highlight price drops and limited-time promotions, making
        the product more appealing to price-conscious consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        By running strategic discount campaigns and aligning them with shopping
        trends, we saw a 41% increase in traffic to the Deals page and a 28.3%
        rise in sales conversions from users searching for discounted energy
        drinks. This not only boosted short-term revenue but also helped build
        long-term brand awareness.
