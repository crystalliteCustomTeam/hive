          A leading HVAC company operating in multiple locations across the
          U.S., with a franchise in England, faced challenges in increasing
          online visibility and lead generation. Despite having an established
          presence in Northern California, Virginia, New York, Georgia, and
          Illinois, their digital performance was not meeting expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Website traffic was inconsistent, conversion rates were lower than
          industry benchmarks, and the Google Business Profile listings were
          underutilized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company needed a strong SEO and digital marketing strategy to
          improve organic traffic, user engagement, and most importantly, lead
          conversions. Over eleven months, we implemented a targeted approach
          that led to significant growth in bookings and business.

          The HVAC industry is highly competitive, with businesses competing for
          visibility in local search results. The company struggled with low
          rankings for high-intent keywords, underperforming GBP listings, and a
          website that was not fully optimized for speed, mobile usability, and
          lead capture. A comprehensive website audit revealed performance
          issues that were affecting both user experience and search rankings.
          The site needed improvements in page speed, mobile optimization, and
          structured data implementation to ensure better indexing and
          visibility on search engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, their GMB profile listings were not fully optimized and
          lacked NAP consistency, leading to fewer local search inquiries. Many
          service pages lacked strong call-to-action elements, reducing their
          effectiveness in converting visitors into leads. These issues had a
          direct impact on bookings, which were not growing at the expected
          rate.

        Since calls and form submissions were essential for generating leads, we
        focused on optimizing the website for higher conversions. We enhanced
        the company’s Google Business Profile to improve local search
        visibility, making it easier for potential clients to find and contact
        them. To encourage more inquiries, we strategically placed
        call-to-action buttons on key pages, guiding visitors toward immediate
        action. Additionally, we strengthened location-based keyword targeting,
        ensuring the company ranked for relevant statewide insurance searches.
        These efforts helped drive more engagement, resulting in a significant
        increase in leads and conversions.

        With the website’s technical foundation improved, we focused on local
        SEO optimization, and conducted keyword research to identify high-value
        search terms in the company’s service areas and incorporated them
        strategically across the website. Service pages were optimized for local
        searches, and new content was created to target location-based queries.
        The Google Business Profile listings were fully optimized with accurate
        business details, high-quality images, and customer reviews, resulting
        in a 21.6% increase in calls from GMB profile in just three months.

        Conversion rate optimization was another crucial aspect of the strategy.
        Clear and strategically placed CTA buttons were added across key pages
        to encourage inquiries. Lead capture forms were redesigned to minimize
        friction, making it easier for users to submit their information. Trust
        signals, such as customer testimonials and industry certifications, were
        integrated to enhance credibility and drive more conversions. These
        efforts led to a 17% increase in key events, including calls and form
        submissions.

        To further strengthen online visibility, we implemented a robust content
        marketing and link-building strategy. Educational blog posts and service
        guides on HVAC maintenance, energy efficiency, and seasonal service tips
        were published to engage users and establish industry authority.
        High-quality backlinks were built through partnerships with local
        businesses, industry directories, and reputable home improvement
        websites, improving the company’s domain authority and search rankings.
        These efforts resulted in an additional 5.4K sessions, reflecting a 20%
        growth in website engagement.
