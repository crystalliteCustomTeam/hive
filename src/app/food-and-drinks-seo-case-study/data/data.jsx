        Our client, a growing brand in the sugar-free energy drink segment,
        faced several challenges, including low organic visibility, no to
        limited presence in Google Shopping and Popular Products, and a lack of
        engagement in online discussions and product recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the brand was not fully leveraging Google’s Deals section
        to attract price-sensitive consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these challenges, there were clear opportunities to improve
        visibility. The increasing demand for sugar-free and keto-friendly
        energy drinks, with Google's constantly changing search results pages,
        new opportunities emerged to improve visibility. By targeting
        high-intent keywords we focused on attracting more traffic and boosting
        sales.
