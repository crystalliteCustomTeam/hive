          Our client, a well-established home décor store that sells designer
          furniture and decorations in Atlanta. They had great products but were
          struggling to attract local customers online. While people in the area
          were searching for home décor, the store wasn’t showing up in search
          results as often as it should.

          We planned a 12-month strategy, and within just 3 months, we started
          seeing massive growth.

        One of the first steps we took was optimizing the client’s Google
        Business Profile. We updated key business details, including store
        hours, categories, and descriptions, ensuring all information was
        accurate and aligned with local search intent. We also introduced
        regular updates and posts, highlighting promotions, new arrivals, and
        special events to keep engagement high.

        These efforts led to a <i>1,200%</i> increase in people requesting

        A strong website is the foundation of any SEO strategy, so we optimized
        the client’s site for local search visibility. and improved product
        pages by enhancing content quality and adding clear calls-to-action
        buttons to guide visitors toward making purchases or booking private
        shopping sessions. Since most users browse on their mobile devices, we
        made sure the website was fully mobile-friendly and provided a smooth,
        fast-loading experience. These updates contributed to a 20.1% increase
        in local SEO traffic within the first three months alone.

        To further strengthen the store’s online authority, we submitted its

        décor blogs. These backlinks helped improve search engine rankings and
        drove highly targeted traffic to the website. As a result, customer
        interactions, including form submissions and inquiries, increased by
        18.5%.

        The store’s <strong>private shopping service</strong> was an untapped

        book. We integrated a <strong>direct booking button</strong> on their
        Google Business Profile and streamlined the scheduling process on their
        website. Additionally, we ran a localized content marketing campaign to
        promote the benefits of private shopping. These improvements led to a{" "}
