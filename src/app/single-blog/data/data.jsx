        your budget is tight? We think it’s just right! At Infiniti Digital, we
        turn every dollar into results with paid marketing strategies that pack
        a punch. No fluff, no waste—just campaigns that drive clicks,
        conversions, and smiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        People are searching for what you offer right now, but instead of
        finding you, they’re clicking on the businesses that actually rank on
        Page 1. That’s lost traffic, lost leads, and lost money every single
        day. Harsh? Yeah. But the truth hurts.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, if you still think SEO isn’t that important? Here’s what you’re up
        against:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>91% of websites get ZERO traffic from Google.</li>
        <li>
          75% of people never scroll past the first page of search results.
        </li>
        <li>Organic traffic converts 2.5x better than paid ads.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Without SEO, your website is just a pretty brochure buried under
        millions of competitors. If you’re not ranking, you’re handing money to
        them on a silver platter.
      </p>
      <h2>So, How Strong is Your Website’s SEO? Let’s Find Out.</h2>
      <p>
        Google either loves your site or ignores it. Answer these 10 questions
        to see which one!
      </p>
      <h2>SEO Score & What It Means</h2>
      <p>
        Your website’s SEO score reflects how well it is optimized for search
        engines. Here’s what different score ranges indicate:
      </p>
      <p className={styles.strongPoints}>90-100: Champion!</p>
      <p>
        Your site is well-optimized, it only requires minor fixes for even
        better performance.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.strongPoints}>60-89: Almost There!</p>
      <p>
        Your SEO is decent but needs improvements in site speed, backlinks, and
        on-page SEO to reach its full potential.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.strongPoints}>30-59: Needs Work!</p>
      <p>
        There are several SEO gaps that require optimization to improve rankings
        and visibility.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.strongPoints}>0-29: Emergency!</p>
      <p>
        Your site has major SEO issues that need immediate attention to prevent
        traffic drops.
      </p>
      <h2>Reality Check</h2>
      <p>
        o, you’ve seen your SEO score… and now what? Are you going to take
        action, or just pretend it’s not a problem? Let’s be real, every single
        day you ignore this, your competition is taking what should be yours.
        They’re ranking higher, getting your traffic, closing your leads, and
        making the money you’re leaving on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google doesn’t care how great your business is. If your site isn’t
        optimized, you’re invisible. And if{" "}
        <a href="#">you’re invisible, you’re losing.</a>
      </p>
